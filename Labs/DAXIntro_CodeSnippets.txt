Lab 1: What is DAX?

Exercise 1: Create calculated columns

LineTotal = Sales[OrderQuantity] * Sales[UnitPrice]


FullName = Customer[FirstName] & " " & Customer[LastName]


Initials = LEFT( [FirstName], 1 ) & LEFT( [LastName], 1 )


Approximate Age = QUOTIENT( INT( NOW() - Customer[BirthDate] ), 365.25 )


Exact Age = 
    /*
    This column computes the customer's age by subtracting their birth year from the current year and then subtracting 1 if their birthday hasn't happened yet.
    */
    VAR ThisYear = YEAR( TODAY() ) // The current year
    VAR BirthYear = YEAR( Customer[BirthDate] ) // Customer birth year
    VAR ThisYearBirthday = DATE( ThisYear, MONTH( Customer[BirthDate] ), DAY( Customer[BirthDate] ) ) // Customer's birthday this year
    VAR BDayHasHappened = IF( ThisYearBirthday <= TODAY(), 0, 1 ) // Return 0 if birthday is on or before today, 1 if it's after
RETURN ( ThisYear - BirthYear ) - BDayHasHappened // This year - birth year. If birthday is after today, subtract 1.
